### BASICS

> - `Activity bar` - the one on the left hand side where you have file explorer
>
> - `Search, Source control, run/debug view, extensions view`
> - `Command palette View` -> Command Palette (Control center for all of the actions in vs code)
>   <br>[This is your savior for any kind of commands you wanna run in vs code]
> - `Panel` (Terminal View)

### CREATING A WORKSPACE

> `File` -> Add folder to workspace [Add as many projects as you would like] -> Save Workspace as

### SPLIT WINDOWS (so you can work on multiple files)

> - Select a file and drag it to over to the right/left/top/bottom side

> - Make changes such as editor.tabSize: 2, editor.formatOnSave: true, window.zoomLevel: 0, workbench.editor.enablePreview: false etc. \
